# Battleship

This program is a modified version of the classic board game battleships in which you take the role of a battleship commander who has to attack enemy ships with limited ammunition.

The app turns battleships into a one-sided game where you get all the fun of shooting at enemy ships without having to worry about your own ships.

## How to play

- At the start the user decides to jump right into the game or get an explanation first
- When the game starts the player sees the game grid without being able to see where the enemy ships are.
- Each turn the player shots at a chosen coordinate.
- There are three ships on the board.
- Every shot gets marked on the game grid. Hits are marked with an 'X' and misses are marked with an 'O'.
- If the player succeeds in sinking all enemy ships within 18 turns they win. Otherwise they are out of ammunition and lose the game.

## Features 

### Welcome Screen:
- From the welcome screen the user can choose to access a short explanation text or start the game immediately.
    - The user has to enter either 'g' or 'e' otherwise an error message will show and the input is requested again.

### Explanation:
- If the user chooses to see the explanation a text is shown on screen that explains everything the user needs to know to play the game.
- At the end the user is requested to press the 'Enter' key to return to the welcome screen
    - The user has to press enter without making any other inputs or an error message will show. The user is then requested again to press the 'Enter' key

### Game:
- The Ships are placed randomly so the game is different every time.
- The game grid is shown and the player is requested to input coordinates to fire at.

### Input validation and error-checking:
- The user cannot enter coordinates outside the game-grid
- The user cannot enter a string longer or shorter than two characters
- The user cannot enter an empty string
- The user can user upper or lower case for letters

### Game ending
- If the player looses the game they get to see where the ships were placed.

- At the end the user can do two things:
    - start a new game by entering 'g'
    - exit and go back to the welcome screen by entering 'e'

### Future Features
- Giving the user feedback when a ship is destroyed
    - Right now the user has to waste valuable shots to confirm a ships length
- Giving the user the possibility to choose the grid size, the amount of ships and the amount of ammunition
    - That way the user can individually set their difficulty at their discretion

## Data Model
As my model, I decided to make a functional base program. The game board is saved as a 
list of lists in a global variable and in that way, it is passed between the different functions. 

There are two copies of the game board variable. One is the board as shown to the player and the other one is used to save the ships' positions.

The Data flows from the create_battlefield function where the battlefield list and its copy are filled with content to the set_ship function where the ships are set on the battlefield_copy. Afterwards, the variables are used by the player_turn function which allows the user to take action and attack different spots on the battlefield list.


## Testing
I performed manual testing throughout this project in the following ways:
- I passed my code through a PEP8 linter to confirm there is no problems with the code
- I have tested all inputs with strings where integers are expected, integers where strings are expected, empty strings, strings that are longer than necessary and strings that are to short
- Throughout development I tested the game in the Gitpod terminal and after deployment to Heroku in the Code Institute terminal template as well.

### Bugs
#### Bug 1:
- Issue: The game grid was empty when printed to the console.
- Solution: I forgot to use the global keyword for the battlefield and the battlefield_copy variables. So I added those to fix it.

#### Bug 2:
- Issue: In set_ship function ships could reach over the border of the game grid and cause an error.
- Solution: Added an if Statement that checks whether the boat is to Long for the grid starting at the first x/y coordinate.

#### Bug 3:
- Both the Battlefield list as well as the battlefield_copy changed when one of them was changed.
- Solution: Using the deepcopy method from the copy library to copy the battlefield list fixed the problem.

#### Remaining bugs
- No bugs remaining

#### Validator
Using https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ a bunch of white space errors were found that were easy to fix by deleting the white space. Other than that no errors were found.
